Have you ever wondered about the reason for creating Docker Containers in the market? Before Docker, there was a big issue faced by most developers whenever they created any code that code was working on that developer computer, but when they try to run that particular code on the server, that code was not working. This happened because apps need the right environment to run (like the right OS, libraries, and settings). If something was different on your computer vs. the server, things would break.

To solve this issue, Docker container comes. Docker is an open-source containerization platform by which you can pack your application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Containers are light in weight, which makes them portable, and they are isolated from the underlying infrastructure and from each other's container. You can run the docker image as a docker container in any machine where docker is installed without depending on the operating system.

There are two big pieces to Docker: The Docker Engine, which is the Docker binary that's running on your local machine and servers and does the work to run your software. The Docker Hub is a website and cloud service that makes it easy for everyone to share their docker images.

Why Docker is Popular?
Docker gained its popularity due to its impact on the software development and deployment. The following are the some of the main reasons for docker becoming popular:

Portability: Docker facilitates the developers in packaging their applications with all dependencies into a single lightweight containers. It facilities in ensuring the consistent performance across the different computing environments.
Reproducibility: Encapsulating the applications with their dependencies within a container it ensures in software setups remaining consistent across the development, testing and production environments.
Efficiency: Docker, through its container-based architecture it optimizes the resource utilization. It allows the developers to run the multiple isolated applications on a single host system.
Scalability: Docker's scalability features facilitated the developers in making easier of their applications handling at time of workloads increment.
