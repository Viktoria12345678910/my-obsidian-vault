The perfect start into the technology.
To get to know and test the WAGO Compact Controller 100 (Item no. 2849-1199/751-9301), WAGO now offers the WAGO Compact Controller 100 Starter Kit for £464. It offers a simple, fast and cost-effective way to start within the WAGO control world – specifically, using the Compact Controller 100, CODESYS and the industrial [[IoT]] world (open automation).


Technical benefits:

Programmable with [[CODESYS 3.5]]
8x DI 24V, 4x DO 24V, 2x AI 0-10V, 2x AI PT1000, 2x AO 0-10V on board
[[Docker]] ready (Node-RED, Grafana, Influx, MQTT)
The starter kit is “ready to use” – users can start and wire directly. The starter kit is therefore ideal for beginning with WAGO controllers and for smaller automation solutions – regardless of the training the user has.
