### Ex. 2 p.24
1. Oracles are compared on the test criteria. **False**
2. The company changes test criteria for each project. **True**
3. Evaluation model testing is recommended for software in the later stages of development. **False**
### Ex. 3 p.24
1. Faults that are predicted are **expected**
2. If an engineer makes a mistake in software's code this is an **error**
3. The **prevention model** attempts to stop faults before they occur.
4. The **evaluation model** detects design and implementation faults
5. Software must meet all **test criteria** before it passes a test
6. Engineers can use an **oracle** as a comparison tool
### Ex.4 p.25
1. failure/fault
	A. A **fault** is caused by a human error in coding or input.
	B. A **failure** is an observable occurrence
2. Fault detection/fault prevention
	A. **Fault prevention** stops problem from occurring
	B. **Fault detection** identifies problems.
3. satisfy/compare
	A. Engineers use programs to **compare** test results with expectations.
	B. Software must **satisfy** certain requirements set by engineers.
4. demonstration model/destruction model
	A. The **demonstration model** ensures the software completes required tasks.
	B. The **destruction model** detects implementation faults.
