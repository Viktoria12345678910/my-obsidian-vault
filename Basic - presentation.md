# BASIC: The Language That Democratized Computing

## Slide 2: What is BASIC?

**Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code**

BASIC was created in 1964 by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth College. Their revolutionary goal was simple yet profound: make programming accessible to everyone, not just mathematicians and scientists. Before BASIC, computers were mysterious machines operated only by specialists in white coats. BASIC changed everything by using simple English-like commands that anyone could understand.

BASIC's genius was its straightforward syntax. A complete program could be written in minutes:

```
10 PRINT "HELLO, WORLD!"
20 INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME"; NAME$
30 PRINT "NICE TO MEET YOU, "; NAME$
40 END
```

Line numbers, simple commands like PRINT, INPUT, and GOTO made programming feel less like advanced mathematics and more like having a conversation with the machine. Students could write their first program on their first day.

When personal computers arrived in the late 1970s and early 1980s, BASIC was there. Every Commodore 64, Apple II, and TRS-80 booted directly into BASIC. An entire generation learned to code by typing programs from magazines, experimenting with graphics, sound, and games. BASIC wasn't just software, it was the gateway drug to the digital revolution. Microsoft itself was founded on a BASIC interpreter.

Is basic dead?
BASIC refused to fade away. It evolved into Visual Basic, which dominated Windows application development in the 1990s. Today it lives on as VB.NET and influenced modern languages like Python with its emphasis on readability. While professionals may mock its GOTO statements and loose structure, BASIC achieved something remarkable: it proved that programming could belong to everyone.

BASIC's philosophy echoes in today's educational languages. Scratch, Python for beginners, and countless coding bootcamps all embrace the same principle: lower the barrier to entry. Millions of programmers wrote their first loop, their first conditional, their first game in BASIC. It taught us that the best programming language isn't the most powerfulâ€”it's the one that gets people started.
