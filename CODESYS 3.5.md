The comprehensive software suite for automation technology
Independent of device manufacturers
The basis:

The "CODESYS Development System" programming tool, which implements the international IEC 61131-3 standard
The control software ("PLC runtime system" or "SoftPLC" or "virtual PLC") for different device platforms
With CODESYS, you can freely select the optimum hardware for your automation application. Many classic automation providers have already implemented CODESYS. Or you can use standard device platforms on which you simply install or deploy the appropriate control software. With virtual controllers, you can even use powerful IT hardware for control and thus reduce hardware costs.
